Visualization tool is launched via "eche_plate_visualize.py" and requires additional repository in the same root directory as JCAPdatavis:

	PythonCompositionPlots
	https://github.com/johnmgregoire/PythonCompositionPlots


The default Anaconda (Python 2.7) install contains all but two module dependencies:

	MySQL-python
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python

	PyQt4
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt4


Linux, OSX, and Windows installers for Anaconda are available here:
